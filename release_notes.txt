    Bug fixes:
	just changes to get this working right.
    v1.12.7-rc1
    New features:
    PowerLoss descent framework.  This invloves reading the bguReport.txt file and using the data therein to signal a drop in elevation
	to lower the craft power requirements to what the craft can produce.  This requires an updated BGU firmware 1.4.43 to generate
	the data and bguLogServer v1.1.9 to receive and deliver it.
    Bug fixes:
    cURL lib takes a few seconds to initialize.  We add a GetColorPalette() call as early as possible to complete
	the init before the user issues and commands and must wait on it.

v1.12.6
    v1.12.6 - rc1
    Bug fixes:
	The path hfCamera file for FoV, zoom table did not include path info
	so it was not being loaded.  Now defined as "/home/pi/hti/apps/fms/hfCamera.xbc-kz10.json"
    New Features:
	Added a sawtooth jitter to RC7 (zoom) of magnitude 20 for use in monitoring traffic upstream to
	the craft.  Craft doesn't log HB, so this acts as a higher resolution method to indicate that
	some data is making it up.  
	some data is making it up.  
	
v1.12.5
    v1.12.5 - rc3
   Bug fixes:
   Fixed a bug in the logging of the Baro3 base pressure.

    v1.12.5 - rc2
    New features:
        Added Thermal thread which reads in and logs the CPU temperature of the RPi.
            Also stores the current value in flightmanagementsystem::m_rpiTemperature (for later use to notify user?) Logs a temperature
            of -100.0 C if the reported temp is >100.0 or < -40.0.  Reads value out of /home/pi/hti/utilities/thermal/temperature file.
            REQUIRES temp_monitor.sh to be running to update the file with the current temperature.  Only logs the first failure if the
            temperature file cannot be opened but will retry every second.
